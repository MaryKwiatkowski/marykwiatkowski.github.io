          <b>Hi, I'm Mary</b>
          <br> Currently, I am a senior completing my final year studying Computer Science in the college of Engineering
          at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University where I work as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant in the
          Computer Science department. <br><br> I hope to pursue a career in software design or web/app development beginning
          in the Summer of 2017. <br><br> My passions include animation, video and audio editing, running, and obsessively listening
          to Survivor podcasts.
